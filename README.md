The objective of this challenge is to build a 2-model Rails app with restaurant and anonymous reviews. You can refer to the Rails guide to see a similar example on articles and comments.

- Models created - done

- Tables created (xml can be found in main folder) - done

- Association - done.

- Validation - done.

- Testing/playing with models (For now, one restaurant with two reviews created) - done

- Routing:
  - As a visitor: Restaurant -> indexDONE/new/create/show
                  Review -> new/create
